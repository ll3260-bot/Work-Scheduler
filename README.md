# Work-Scheduler (Ready for GitHub & Netlify)

This is the full source version of Work-Scheduler. Upload all files into the root of your GitHub repository (replace current files) and Netlify will build automatically.

Important: upload the SOURCE files (include src/, package.json, vite.config.js). Do NOT upload only the dist/ folder.

Local dev:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. npm run build
